# antilitecoin

antilitecoin is not antibitcoin, it is the anarchists coin. It is antilitecoin as well

  - 84 million coins
  - Halves at 840,000
  - 30 second blocks and 5 minutes to retarget
  - 50 coins per block
  - Initial bonanza blocks for early adopters at 500 coins and 250 coins

It has been well-known for some time that litecoin sucks. It was popular for a while becuse of Gox shilling it every 2 months or so.  Yet there are many litecoin victims some paying $43 for a wee bit of nothing.



### Version
1.0.0.1

### Tech
It works, and has a 500 coin reward, then 250 and finally 50 for about 830,000 blocks. Then it halves and will be worth half of bitcoin. Do the maths:
